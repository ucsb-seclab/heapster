# Entry point of the firmware. This usually
# corresponds to the ResetHandler of the blob.
# DEFAULT: 0x0

# For instance Texas Instrument
# blobs have a custom header and the IVT does not appear

# List of memory ranges in which we have RAM.
# e.g., [[region_name, start_addr, end_addr, path_to_ramdisk]]
# If the path to ramdisk is empty we'll plug a

# be backed by that file.

# If the path to ramdisk is empty we'll plug a

# be filled with that.
